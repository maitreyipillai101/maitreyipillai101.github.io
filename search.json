    "text": "Creating a Qualtrics Survey\n\nAnalysis of the survey\na. The survey is structured in an order such that the repondent sees only one question at a time.\nb. The questionnaire is composed of many multiple choice questions, questions that have binary responses but none that has select as many that apply.\nc. The order of the questions is weird. For instance, one of the instructions was to apply the skip logic on Q4 to Q7 if the answer for the fourth was a no. However, profanity and nudity has got nothing to do with the responses of actual costs or an estimation of the software costs in general. They could be ordered in a more meaningful way, that has a more refined flow to it.\nFurther Assignment: I was not able to find the \"Diversity and Inclusiveness Survey\" in my qualtrics library."
